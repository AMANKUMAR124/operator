1 What are the Conditional Operators in Java?

In Java, conditional operators are used to perform conditional operations, i.e., to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most commonly used conditional operator is the ternary operator (?:), which is a shorthand for an if-else statement.

Ternary operator syntax:

java
Copy code
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
If condition is true, expression1 is executed; otherwise, expression2 is executed.

Example:

java
Copy code
int a = 10, b = 5;
int result = (a > b) ? a : b;  // result will be 10 since a > b
O< What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?

Operators in Java can be classified based on the number of operands they work with:

Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand. Examples:
+ (positive), - (negation), ++ (increment), -- (decrement), ! (logical NOT)
Binary Operators: Operate on two operands. Examples:
Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
Relational: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical: &&, ||
Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
Ternary Operator: Operates on three operands. Example:
condition ? expr1 : expr2
2 What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?

The switch statement is used to execute one out of multiple possible blocks of code based on the value of an expression. It is generally more efficient than multiple if-else statements when you need to compare a variable against many possible values.

Example:

java
Copy code
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
In this example, the program will print "Wednesday" because day is 3.

3 What are the priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java?

In Java, arithmetic operators have the following priority (from highest to lowest):

Parentheses (): Operations inside parentheses are performed first.
Unary operators: ++, --, + (positive), - (negation), ~ (bitwise NOT)
Multiplication, Division, and Modulus: *, /, %
Addition and Subtraction: +, -
If operators of the same precedence level appear in an expression, they are evaluated from left to right (except for unary operators, which are evaluated from right to left).

4 What are the conditional statements and the use of conditional statements in Java?

Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. They are used to execute certain blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

if statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
if-else statement: Executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another if it is false.
else-if statement: Checks multiple conditions and executes code based on the first condition that is true.
switch statement: Executes code based on the value of an expression (usually used for comparing a single variable to multiple values).
Example of if-else statement:

java
Copy code
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
5 What is the syntax of the if-else statement?

The if-else statement syntax in Java is:

java
Copy code
if (condition) {
    // Block of code if condition is true
} else {
    // Block of code if condition is false
}
Example:

java
Copy code
int num = 10;
if (num > 5) {
    System.out.println("Number is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is not greater than 5");
}
6 What are the 3 types of iterative statements in Java?

The three types of iterative (looping) statements in Java are:

for loop: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

Syntax:
java
Copy code
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:
java
Copy code
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but ensures that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax:
java
Copy code
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
7 Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?

The difference between a for loop and a do-while loop:

for loop: The condition is checked before the loop executes, so the block of code may not run at all if the condition is false initially.

Example:
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i); // This runs only if i < 5
}
do-while loop: The block of code inside the loop will run at least once because the condition is checked after the code is executed.

Example:
java
Copy code
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i); // This runs at least once
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
8 Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.

Hereâ€™s a simple Java program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
Output:

Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
This program uses the for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and prints each number on a new line.
